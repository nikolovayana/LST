    "The aim is to obtain temporal statistics of Land Surface Temperature (LST) over a chosen location (area or a signle point) in OSA Peninsula. At hand we have Planet LST data which has a pixel resolution of 100m x 100m and is acqured over the whole globe twice a day, each day, since 2002. This means we can monitor daily, monthly of annual changes of surface temperature either at daytime (13:30 solar time) or at night (01:30 solar time). {CHECK WHAT IS SOLAR TIME}.  This LST data was provided to OSA Conservation by Planet through Project Centinela: https://www.planet.com/project-centinela/ (learn more for Project Centinela in this Blog Post: https://www.planet.com/pulse/planets-project-centinela-monitoring-vulnerable-biodiversity-hotspots-for-conservation-action/\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook showcases analyses with LST data, it can be easily adapted for other Planet Variables, such as above ground carbon density.\n",

    "### Accessing the data: Why bother with Python coding? üêç\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are more than 3000 LST images available since 2020, we want to find a way to analyse this data without downloading it to our computers. Thus to do the LST time-series analyses, we will use Sentinel Hub EO Browser (what is Sentinel Hub a plaform, cloud based application or...?), now updated to Planet Insights Platform:\n",

    " With Sentinel Hub we can visualize images and temporal statistics without downloading a single file. So, now we have two options. The first option is to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of Sentinel Hub - that is the web application with all its \"buttons\" and \"select\" fields, where the results are shown on an interactive map. The disadvantage of this option is that once we do the analyses it is difficult to reproduce it, since it involved a lot of button clicking. If we want to tell someone else how to repeat the research we did, we need to create a very detailed description of all the steps we took in the GUI and that can be very time consuming. Here comes the second option, where we can use a bit of programming with Python to create a script with which we will run the analyses (in our case the script is within a Jupyter Notebook). In this way all the steps of the research are present and easily accessinle in the script. Such a code can them be easily shared with other users, and they can change just few parameter (like the area where the analyses is done or the temporal time frame of the statistics) and run exatly the same analyses. And why Python? It is simply one of the easiest programming languages out there and it is widely used in reserch with a lot of example code available in the internet. The other option is to use the langauge R, but in my opinien Pyhton is much easier to start with.\n",

    "### Diving into the world of APIs ü§ø\n",
    "So, if we are going to do analyses on satelitte images through python coding, how are we going to access those images, without downloading them? The answer is: API. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that lets one software application talk to another. In our case we with our code are going to talk to Sentinel Hub where all images are stored and we will just request information on statisical data (which is our aim) but without downloading the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ In Simple Terms:\n",
    "An API is like a menu at a restaurant:\n",
    "* The menu lists what you can order (satellite images to which we have access or functions we can use).\n",
    "* You don't need to know how the kitchen works (the internal way Planet is storing and processing images).\n",
    "* You just make a request, and the system gives you a response (like the LST values for a location through time)\n",
    "\n",
    "I imagine that you can underastand this nice association, but it is too abstract and you wonder what exactly is API, how does it look in code? üß© In programming, an API is just a set of functions, classes, or URLs provided by some other software that you can use to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps you say: <br>\n",
    "üßë‚Äçüíª \"Hey, do this task for me and give me the result.\"<br>\n",
    "üñ•Ô∏è \"Sure, here you go!\"<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a Web API ( using ```requests```). Let‚Äôs say you want to get a random joke from a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.get(\"https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke\")\n",
    "\n",
    "data = response.json()\n",
    "print(data[\"setup\"])\n",
    "#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What‚Äôs happening:\n",
    "* ```requests.get(...)``` ‚Üí you call a web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The URL is like asking a service: ‚ÄúGive me a joke.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "* You get back JSON data (text structured like Python dictionaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "* You print it.\n",

    "### The diversity of Planet' APIs üåø\n",
    "There is an overwheliming amount of APIs provided by Planet, and it is hard to decide where to start. After reading a bunch of API documentation, I found out that the most user friendly way to access Planet data is through the Sentinel Hub API, which can be used to explore, download or visualize data. We need to learn how to search and order commercial data (Planet Variables which includes the LST data) using the API, visualize it in EO Browser, generate time-series and view statistical information. Check the webinar on Commercial data for a full overview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkFQxzxpLAA.‚ùóüü† There is also a cool blog post in Medium with some easy to understand explanations for \"orders\" and \"subscriptions\": https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/commercial-datasets-done-mostly-right-always-fresh-511f68373e83\n",
